Problem 73 Counting fractions in a range: https://projecteuler.net/problem=73

Description:

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.
How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000?

Solution:

In the following, d and x will always be natural numbers.


- Consider first only even values for d.
    The function "f(d, x) = ((d/2) - x) / d" has two properties that are useful for this problem:
        1) f(d, x) < 1/2 for every d and x
        2) d(x, x) > 1/3 has a closed form solution, for a fixed d, that is x < d/6


    Therefore, the number of possible fractions that lie between 1/3 and 1/2 for an even d is: x = math.floor(d/6.000000001)
    where the additional small value is added keeping in mind that we want x to be strictly smaller than d/6

    For each of those candidate, if the gcd between the candidate itself and d is 1 then we found a valid fraction.
    Otherwise, the fraction is not a proper reduced fraction.

- Now consider the odd values for d.
    Following the same reasoning and defining "f(d, x) = (((d-1)/2) - x) / d", we can conclude that
        1) The function is always smaller than 1/2
        2) The number of valid candidates is x < (d-3)/6, which is given by math.floor((d-3.000000001)/6.000000001) + 1, keeping in mind that x must be an integer.


    The final part follows exactly the case for even values.
