Problem 205 Dice Game: https://projecteuler.net/problem=205

Description:

Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.
Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total wins. 
The result is a draw if the totals are equal.

What is the probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic Colin? 
Give your answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg

Solution:

The probability that, for a fixed n, the sum of the dice is exactly n is given by
`number of combinations such that sum is n` / `number of total combinations`.
That probability is computed with the two helper functions count_four_sided() and count_six_sided().

Given a fixed n, between 7 and 36, the player with the four sided dice wins if and only if the sum
of the nine dice is bigger than the same of six dice. We can compute this probability as:
(1 - P(sum of four sided < n)) * P(sum of six sided = n).

In conclusion, the final solution is obtained as the sum of the probabilities that the
player with the four sided dice wins, for any 7 <= n <= 36.
